Like a man from Atlanta
A man from Cali
Turned Africa into Miami

I'll be in Hawaii
Catch me in paris
I'll be at home barely
I sleep when im buried
What i need some sleep for
Went to Japan and made a milli in a week love

I tell you why

'Cause i'm in my own world
Where else would i be?
It's your last chance
To see what I see

(I gots to talk
I gotta tell what i feel
I gotta talk about my life as I see it)

We got it working like back in the eighties
See the money, and they don't move me
We'll have a conversation
I know you'll quote me
I travelled the seven seas
Flying high
Smoking better trees
Whatever haters say
I'm as real as they come
In a blink of an eye i was there
But now i'm gone
I tell you why

'Cause im in my own world
Where else would i be?
It's your last chance
To see what i see

'Cause im in my own world
Where else would i be?
It's your last chance
To keep up with it

You couldn't duplicate this shit
If i told you how to, man
