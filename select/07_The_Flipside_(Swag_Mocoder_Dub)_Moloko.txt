Can't leave you alone
We can't leave you alone, no

You can't hide from the flipside
Your foolish pride
Can't sustain the strain
Trouble bubbles inside

You can try but you cannot resist
If we insist, persistent, every instant
Every moment in time
We are on your mind

Can't leave you alone
We can't leave you alone, no

We have ways to make you understand
We demand you let us in
Under your skin

You tuned in to the frequency
We can't let you be
We live happily, beneath
On the underneath
On the inside, the flipside

Can't leave you alone
We can't leave you alone, no

In your search for contentment
Tormented, unrelenting
Turbulent intent

And all the money spent
You will listen precisely to each word
As it reoccurs

We insinuate, irritate
We can't dissipate
Deflate your ego
Give up self control

Can't leave you alone
We can't leave you alone, no
We can't leave you alone
Can't leave you alone, no

When will it end?
Delirium is back again
We will suspend
Numskulls are back around again

Trouble bubbles inside
You cannot hide from the flipside
We are in your mind
Every instant, every moment in time

We're alive and we will survive
As a part of you
Listen if we want you to
Can't you see?
Just a part of you are we

Surround sound, you can't turn it down
A little frequency, dependency
You are we, all on your own
We can't leave you alone, no

We can't leave you alone
We can't leave you alone

We can't leave you alone
(Leave you alone)
We can't leave you alone, no
We can't leave you alone
(We can't leave you alone)
We can't leave you alone, no

We can't leave you alone
(We can't leave you alone)
We can't leave you alone, no
(We can't leave you alone)
We can't leave you alone
We just can't leave you alone

We can't leave you alone
We can't leave you alone, no
We can't leave you alone
(We just can't leave you alone)
We can't leave you alone, no

We can't leave you alone
We can't leave you alone, no
We can't leave you alone
We just can't leave you alone

We can't leave you alone
We can't leave you alone, no
We can't leave you alone
We can't leave you alone, no
(Give up self control)

We can't leave you alone
We can't leave you alone, no
(Come on, give up self control)
We can't leave you alone
We just can't leave you alone
